### Goal of Asea Software License

Main purpose of Asea Software License is to protect software and its authors, contributors and users by plainly stating that altered redistributed source code and/or altered redistributions of original software in binary form must be plainly marked as such and must not be misrepresented as being the original software, without restricting freedom of users as [defined](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) by GNU Project. Asea Software License is rough combination of [bsd-3-clause](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) and [zlib](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib) licenses.

### Q&A

##### 1. Is Asea Software License really an open source software license?
It should be even without official recognition by Open Source Initiative. This license is built on belief that recipients of software in any form should have access to information about the contents of the software and must not be misled by those who redistribute original software or its modified versions. In reality, this additional condition is already common practice in cases when software packages are distributed with changes and are marked as being altered, for example by maintainers of packages for various Linux distributions.

##### 2. Is Asea Software License really free (libre) software license?
Hopefully it is, however Free Software Foundation might have different opinion and might suggest using different software license instead. Compatibility with GPL is not confirmed, so please be aware of this fact and treat software licensed under Asea Software License as incompatible with GPL unless stated otherwise.

##### 3. Is Asea Software License a copyleft software license?
No. This license should provide a reasonable and free way for making software available to everyone in both source code and binary forms and it is not trying to completely take control over ways of redistribution of the original software. Both authors and users of this software should be free but those who will try to misuse the possibility of modified redistribution of original software against its users can not claim that authors of original software are responsible for changes, which can be both significant improvements or malicious features.

##### 3. Should I use Asea Software License for my project?
Likely not. There are licenses available which might better suit your personal needs, your project's goals and which are more mature in legal terms. This license was created to protect me, my work, contributors and recipients of my work in belief that it is sufficient enough in specific cases when public domain and most used BSD-like licenses are not. Rather than valid legal document subjected strictly to copyright law it could be seen also as fair mutual contract between authors of the original software, redistributors and users with guaranteed access to information.

##### 4. What about patents?
Software patents are treachery and there is no valid reason for their existence other than greed and need for control. This is the main and only reason why Asea Software License does not address or respond to issue of software patents in any way because it does not recognize possibility of existence of software patents in software licensed with this license ever and at all.

##### 5. What about trademarks?
The issue of trademarks could be addressed separately, however third and fourth clauses of Asea Software License could be seen also as an attempt to respond to this issue by protecting original software and its 'name', its authors and contributors and by making users well informed about the changes in altered redistributions in source code or binary forms of original software.

##### 6. Why is this license not called BSD-4-clause?
BSD-4-clause might cause confusion with the Original BSD license, also known as 4-clause BSD license, which is also incompatible with GPL.

##### 7. Doesn't this license cause similar problem as Original BSD license?
Third clause of Asea Software License is not related to advertising materials and it does not require you to mention original software at all. Requiring redistributors and developers to inform users about changes and protecting authors of original software should be common practice.
